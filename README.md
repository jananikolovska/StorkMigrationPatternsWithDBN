# Project FAIKR3 - 1
---
TO-DO:
1. Run the script to add weather data so you have as much data as possible
2. Update the pgmpy_try: 
   * new discretization
   * step by step fitting with plots showing difference of CPD after every itteration
   * CPD tables too slow to compute
3. Overall new visualization and maybe a streamlit app
4. Start Latex docummentation
