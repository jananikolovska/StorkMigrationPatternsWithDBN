# ðŸª½ Exploring Stork Migration Patterns with DBN Analysis
---
### TO-DO:
1. Run the script to add weather data so you have as much data as possible
2. Update the pgmpy_try: 
   * ~~new discretization~~
   * step by step fitting with plots showing difference of CPD after every itteration
   * ~~CPD tables too slow to compute~~
3. Overall new visualization and maybe a streamlit app
4. Start Latex docummentation
5. Start Powerpoint
6. Finish Preprocess_data and InitialDataExploration
